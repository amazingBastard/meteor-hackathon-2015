As a buyer
I want to start a trade
So I can get cool items

  Scenario: Start a trade
   Given I'm logged in
   And I'm on '/'
   When I double tap an item
   And I visit /profile
   Then I should see the item in a list
   And the item should have a status of 'open' and 'offered'

As a seller
I want to be notified of a new trade
So I can take care of it

  Scenario: Seller is notified of a new trade
    Given I log-in to the app
    When I visit '/myprofile'
    Then I should see a list of items
    With a status of 'open' and 'offered'

  Scenario: Counter a trade item

    Given I have a new trade
    And I decline the offered item
    And I propose a counter item
    Then the item should have a status of 'open' and 'countered'

  Scenario: Accept a trade

    Given I have a new trade
    When I accept the offered item
    Then the item should have a status of 'closed' and "successful"

  Scenario: Decline a trade

    Given I have a new trade
    When I decline the offered item
    Then the item should have a status of 'closed' and 'denied'

buyer = loggedInUser
seller = loggedInUser

offered item = buyerId + item they like
counter item = countered, sellerId + item they like
